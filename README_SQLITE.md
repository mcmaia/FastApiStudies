Certainly! Below is an updated version of the documentation for using SQLite with FASTAPI. This includes instructions for accessing the SQLite instance from the `database_old_sqlite.py` file within your repository.

# Getting Started with FASTAPI and SQLite

This guide will walk you through the basic setup to get started with FASTAPI, a modern web framework for building APIs with Python, using SQLite for database operations.

## Prerequisites

- Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Installation

1. **Install FASTAPI**:

    ```bash
    pip install fastapi
    ```

2. **Install Uvicorn** (ASGI server):

    ```bash
    pip install uvicorn
    ```

## Usage

1. **Clone this Repository**:

    Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
    ```

2. **Access SQLite Instance**:

    In this repository, if you want to use SQLite, you can find the SQLite instance and database operations in the `database_old_sqlite.py` file. You can modify or extend this file to suit your needs.

    ```python
    # database_old_sqlite.py

    from sqlalchemy import create_engine
    from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
    from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base


    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = 'sqlite:///./todosapp.db'

    engine = create_engine(SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL, connect_args={'check_same_thread': False})

    SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)

    Base = declarative_base()  
    ```

3. **Run FASTAPI App**:

    Once you've set up the database operations in `database_old_sqlite.py`, you can run your FASTAPI app using Uvicorn:

    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```

    Replace `main` with the name of your Python file containing the FASTAPI app.

## Conclusion

You've now set up a basic environment to work with FASTAPI and SQLite. Feel free to explore more features of FASTAPI and customize your application as needed.

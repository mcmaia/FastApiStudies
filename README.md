# Getting Started with FASTAPI and PostgreSQL

This guide will walk you through the basic setup to get started with FASTAPI, a modern web framework for building APIs with Python, along with PostgreSQL database integration using psycopg2-binary.

## Prerequisites

- Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- PostgreSQL installed and running on your system. You can download it from [postgresql.org](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

## Installation

1. **Install FASTAPI**:

    ```bash
    pip install fastapi
    ```

2. **Install Uvicorn** (ASGI server):

    ```bash
    pip install uvicorn
    ```

3. **Install psycopg2-binary** (PostgreSQL adapter for Python):

    ```bash
    pip install psycopg2-binary
    ```

    **Note**: psycopg2-binary is required to work with PostgreSQL in Python. It provides a way to interact with PostgreSQL databases from Python code.

## Usage

1. **Create a FASTAPI app**:

    Create a new Python file (e.g., `main.py`) and import necessary modules:

    ```python
    from fastapi import FastAPI

    app = FastAPI()
    ```

2. **Run the app with Uvicorn**:

    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```

    This command will start the ASGI server and reload the server automatically when code changes are detected.

3. **Connect to PostgreSQL**:

    Before using PostgreSQL with FASTAPI, make sure you have a PostgreSQL server running and you know the connection details (e.g., host, port, username, password).

    You can establish a connection to PostgreSQL using psycopg2-binary:

    ```python
    import psycopg2

    # Establish connection
    connection = psycopg2.connect(
        dbname="your_database",
        user="your_username",
        password="your_password",
        host="localhost",
        port="5432"
    )

    # Create a cursor object
    cursor = connection.cursor()

    # Execute SQL queries
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM your_table")

    # Fetch data
    rows = cursor.fetchall()

    # Close cursor and connection
    cursor.close()
    connection.close()
    ```

    Replace `"your_database"`, `"your_username"`, `"your_password"`, `"localhost"`, and `"5432"` with your actual PostgreSQL database details.

## Conclusion

You've now set up a basic environment to work with FASTAPI and PostgreSQL using psycopg2-binary. Feel free to explore more features of FASTAPI and customize your application as needed.
